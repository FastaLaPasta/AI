These projects not only illustrate my technical skills but also my ability to document and structure work for professional presentation.

## Setup & Usage

Each project folder contains its own `README.md` with specific setup instructions. Generally, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies as listed in each project's `requirements.txt`
